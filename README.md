<h1>Portfolio UI</h1>

<p><b>Description:</b>The intentions behind this project was to create a modern portfolio website using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript keeping my code as clean as possible. Some of the design features I used along the way of developing this project were neomorphism design, fully responsive layout, color skins, fade-in / fade-out, live style switcher, W3C validation, custom fonts, and more.
